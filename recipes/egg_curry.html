    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Egg curry is a comforting Indian dish of curried eggs. It is basically made with hard boiled eggs, onions, tomatoes, whole & ground spices and herbs. Indian cuisine is very diverse and an egg curry is made in several ways, with recipes varying by state and even by family.You can make an egg curry in countless ways and I have shared more than 10 ways on this blog to make curried eggs. But this Punjabi dhaba style egg curry is very special & my family loves this.</p>

        <p>For the uninitiated, Dhabas are roadside budget restaurants hugely popular in India. You are sure to find a dhaba on the outskirts/ suburbs of every town and city all over India. At one time, these existed on the Highways for the convenience of truck drivers & travelers but in the recent years dhabas are everyone's favorite.
