    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Dosa also known as Dosai, is a classic popular South Indian crepe made with fermented lentil and rice batter.
        Restaurants often serve them as a meal with coconut chutney and sambar. But they taste equally good with any
        other spicy chutney or vegetable kurma.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lentils</li>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Cold Filtered Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>

            
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> In a bowl take ½ cup idli rice or parboiled rice along with ½ cup regular rice.</li>
            <li>To the same bowl, add ¼ cup urad dal and ⅛ teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi)</li>
            <li>Rinse the rice, lentils and methi seeds together a couple of times and keep them aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, take 2 tablespoons of thick poha</li>
            <li>Add 1.5 cups of water and mix. Cover with a lid and soak everything for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
            <li>Drain all the water and add the soaked ingredients to a mixer grinder or a blender.</li>
            <li>Add ½ teaspoon of edible rock salt. Mix very well. Instead of rock salt, you can use non-iodized salt or sea salt crystals or Himalayan pink salt.</li>
            <li>Cover and allow to ferment for 8 to 9 hours or more. The time of fermentation will vary depending on the temperature conditions, climate and altitude.</li>
            <li>Heat a cast iron pan. When the pan becomes hot, spread ¼ to ½ teaspoon oil all over the pan with a spoon or with a thick paper towel dipped in oil. For a richer taste, you can cook the dosa with ghee or butter.</li>
            <li>Dosa is ready!</li>

            
        </ol>
