    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        While there are many delicious Indian Paneer Curries made with cottage cheese, this paneer gravy recipe is one
        of my favorites. The addition of onion paste and the special spice blend make this paneer curry recipe quite
        different from others I have posted on the blog.

        You may have encountered a similar style of paneer curry in Indian restaurants; sometimes you’ll see it made
        with potatoes and peas in addition to paneer.</p>

    <p>Whenever I make recipes that feature paneer, I make my own version of the beloved Indian cottage cheese at home;
        I’d choose Homemade Paneer over store bought every time!
